# BruinMart: An Easier Way to Trade

[Project URL](https://jerrylzy.github.io/BruinMart/)

## Goal
We want to improve the experience of Facebook's Free & For Sale groups. 

## Idea
We want users to rely less on direct communication because the system can handle a lot of it automatically, i.e. the availability of an item.

## Features
We used `React`, `Redux` and `Firebase` to build this single-page web application prototype that supports
 - Register
 - Login
 - Search
 - Reserve an item
 - Post an item
 - View your items that are reserved by other users
 - View other people's items that you reserve
 - Cancel the reservation by other users
 - Cancel the reservation by you

## Efforts on User Experience
We applied many HCI principles to make our prototype easier to understand and use, including but not limited to 
* contract
* error prevention
* grouping by proximity and similarity
* recognition instead of recall
